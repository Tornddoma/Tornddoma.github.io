# Part and Application

The part that was created through the use of generative design for this project was a part from my laptop stand. (Images of the stand with the original part are provided in the gallery at the end of this page.) 
Overview of the Part and Application
▪ Describe your final part and the real-world context it was designed for.
▪ What problem does it solve or what function does it improve?
▪ Why was this object or use case relevant or meaningful to you?


# Preserve and Obstacle Geometry

▪ What were the critical preserve regions in your model (e.g., mounting
points, tool interfaces, constrained paths)?
▪ How did you define obstacle geometry (i.e., space the part must avoid)?


# Load Case Application and Structural Constraints

▪ Explain the types of forces you applied in the generative design study and
why each was necessary.
▪ How did you determine the magnitude, direction, and location of each
load?
▪ Where did you apply structural constraints, and how did this affect the
results?
▪ How can you test your real-world prototype to further refine the loads?

## Table of Forces Applied

| Force | Magnitude | Location | Rational |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Bearing | 1 | ------- | ------- |
| Force | 1 | ------- | ------- |
| Force | 1 | ------- | ------- |
| Moment| 12 | ------- | ------- |


# Critique of Generative Design

▪ In your experience, how useful is generative design for practical
engineering or prototyping?
▪ What limitations did you encounter?
▪ In what types of applications or industries would generative design be
most useful? Where might it fall short?
