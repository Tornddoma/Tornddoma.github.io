# Introduction to μfluidic Devices

**What are μFluidic Devices?** describe ufluidic devices (generally)
**What is Pinch Flow Fractionation (PFF)?** what is it and how does it work
**What is Asymmetric Pinched Flow Fraction (AsPFF)?**
**Applications Requiring the Sorting of Small Particles** provide at least one specific application that requires sorting of small particles. Include
at least one citation from primary literature. 

# Instructions (Mold to Device)

• How to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device (Lab on a Chip paper). Include
the following steps but with additional detail:
1. **CAD Model** 
2. **Print and cure mold** 
3. **Parylene device** 
4. **Cast PDMS** 
5. **Plasma bond glass slide** 

# Discussion

• Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS? What are
hypothetical applications of your microfluidic mixer or sorter?
• Why is your geometry conducive to sorting? Discuss specific dimensions (pinch width,
outlet width, location of ports, etc.)
• What steps or design features did you use to ensure that each outlet received the same
flow rate, preventing disruptions to the streamlines and maintaining proper separation?
• Based on the results of testing, could you implement any future changes to improve
sorting?
• Did you attempt the bonus opportunity? If so, describe your approach and success.
