# Introduction to Microfluidic Devices

* **What are μFluidic Devices?** As the name implies, microfluidic devices are small devices that utilize fluid flow to perform a task. They can conduct tests by collecting samples, manipulating them, and analyzing the results. Some forms of manipulation include particle or liquid separation, mixing, and droplet generation. Microfluidic devices rely on capillary action to move liquids through their channels, allowing the liquid to flow without external forces. The device created for this project focused solely on sorting particles of varying sizes.
* **What is Pinch Flow Fractionation (PFF)?** Pinch flow fractionation is a method of sorting particles in microfluidics through the use of a particle stream and a buffer stream. These two streams are sent through a narrow, pinched area where the buffer stream from one inlet pushes the particles from the other inlet against the wall. After exiting the pinched area, the combined (but unmixed) stream enters a broader area, where laminar flow causes the particles to move along a set path. The path of a particle depends on the width of the pinched and broad sections, as well as the diameter of the particle. Larger particles, whose centers are positioned farther from the wall when pushed against it, will flow further away from the wall of the broad section—but not beyond half of its width. Since the particles are spaced out, outlets can be placed to collect the sorted particles.
* **What is Asymmetric Pinched Flow Fraction (AsPFF)?** Asymmetric pinched flow fractionation (AsPFF) is a particle-sorting method similar to the PFF method. The key difference between the two is that AsPFF utilizes varying flow rates, whereas in PFF, the outlet flow rates must be equal. AsPFF achieves this by using asymmetric branch channels, where a single outlet is larger and usually shorter compared to the particle-collecting outlets. The larger outlet, called the drain channel, directs most of the liquid flow, creating an effect that amplifies the difference in particle positions against the sidewall during the pinch. This allows for the sorting of much smaller particles or cases where the  particles have minimal size differences.

at least one citation from primary literature. 

# Instructions (Mold to Device)

• How to go from the 3D printed mold to the final device (Lab on a Chip paper). Include
the following steps but with additional detail:
1. **CAD Model** 
2. **Print and cure mold** 
3. **Parylene device** 
4. **Cast PDMS** 
5. **Plasma bond glass slide** 

# Discussion

• Why are resin-printed molds coated with parylene prior to casting the PDMS? What are
hypothetical applications of your microfluidic mixer or sorter?
• Why is your geometry conducive to sorting? Discuss specific dimensions (pinch width,
outlet width, location of ports, etc.)
• What steps or design features did you use to ensure that each outlet received the same
flow rate, preventing disruptions to the streamlines and maintaining proper separation?
• Based on the results of testing, could you implement any future changes to improve
sorting?
• Did you attempt the bonus opportunity? If so, describe your approach and success.
