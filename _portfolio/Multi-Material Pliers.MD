# Project Description

The project's goal was to create a working pair of multimaterial pliers using a flexible spring component. The pliers would be used to pick up resistors to test their functionality. Due to the limitations of the multimaterial printer, assembling parts made from different materials was allowed. However, if the multi-part approach was taken, the parts had to be hand-pressed together without the use of tools or external assistance.

Print-in-place is a form of multimaterial 3D printing that enables more complex designs using multiple materials to be printed on a single print bed simultaneously, rather than printing each part separately using one material at a time on different beds. This method eliminates the need to print separate parts and assemble them afterward. Print-in-place can be achieved through printer designs such as tool changers or multimaterial single extruders. Other, more expensive methods of achieving multimaterial printing include using independent print cartridges.

One application of print-in-place technology is in soft robotics. This field of robotics utilizes softer and more flexible materials to enable interaction with delicate objects. A common example is soft grippers, which can be printed using the multimaterial print-in-place method. These grippers typically have a softer, more flexible exterior for safe handling of fragile items and a more rigid interior for structural integrity.

Many material combinations work well with print-in-place printing; however, the best combination depends on the specific application. For the multimaterial pliers, an ideal combination would include both a rigid and a flexible material—providing a firm structure for the user to hold and grip the resistors while incorporating flexibility to allow the pliers to return to their original shape after being released. For this project, PLA and TPU 95 were used to achieve this functionality.

research to determine other applications print-in-place has been used. What
combination of materials work well for print-in-place?
